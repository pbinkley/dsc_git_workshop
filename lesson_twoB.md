Lesson 2B: Adding GitHub
========================

Git is essentially a *decentralized* system, meaning that any repository
can be shared in multiple locations and kept in sync using **git
commit** and **git push**. However, most people like to work in a
centralized way by using GitHub as a cloud-storage solution for their
repositories. GitHub allows you to upload your repositories, but also
has additional features like issue-tracking, project-based wikis, etc.
