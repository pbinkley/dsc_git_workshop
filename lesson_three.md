Part Three: GitHub Pages and Static Sites
------------------------------------------

1. GitHub Pages

GitHub allows you to turn any repository into a web-page. There are two
kinds of web-pages, one for a user, and one for a particular project.
I use the two kinds of pages on my website. The user-level page has a
**username.github.io** URL (e.g.
[https://redlibrarian.github.io](https://redlibrarian.github.io)), while
project-level pages has a **username.github.io/repository** URL (e.g.
[https://redlibrarian.github.io/open-ideas-2019](https://redlibrarian.github.io/open-ideas-2019]).

You *can* do some of the setup for a github page in the GitHub settings
section, but I find it easier to manage from the director you're working
in.
