Part Three: GitHub Pages and Static Sites
------------------------------------------

1. GitHub Pages

GitHub allows you to turn any repository into a web-page. There are two
kinds of web-pages, one for a user, and one for a particular project.
I use the two kinds of pages on my website. The user-level page has a
**username.github.io** URL (e.g.
[https://redlibrarian.github.io](https://redlibrarian.github.io)), while
project-level pages has a **username.github.io/repository** URL (e.g.
[https://ualbertalib.github.io/](https://ualbertalib.github.io/).

You *can* do some of the setup for a github page in the GitHub settings
section, but I find it easier to manage from the director you're working
in.

[Exercise 11: Your First GitHub Page](exercises/exercise11.md)

You can make GitHub pages as elaborate as you like, except that they
have to be static (i.e. they can't be backed by a database, and they
can't use server-side scripting, like PHP). There are many sophisticated
static-site generators you can use, like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). If you're interested in minimal
computing and digital libraries, you can deploy a [Wax
site](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/) (which uses Jekyll) to GitHub
pages.
