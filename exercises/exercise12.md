Exercise 12: Creating a Presentation with Reveal.js
----------------------------------------------------

Note: this exercise will omit specifying the commands when we have seen
them before. 

You should have a directory containing all the Reveal.js files,
initialized to be a git repository. Inside the directory, take a look at
the files that are there. Most of them you don't need to worry about.
The main file is the **index.html**. 

1. Now that we have the software, we want to create a GitHub repository to
store our presentation. In GitHub go to your own account page, and
create a new repository called **reveal**.

2. Once you have created the repository, follow the same steps you did
before to push an existing repository (which holds your reveal files)
from the command line. 

3. Once you have pushed your project to master, create a new branch
   called **gh-pages**.

4. Edit the index.html file and look for a tag called "section". In
   between the opening and closing section tags, replace what's there
   with a made up title of a presentation, your name, and your
   department. Then save the file and exit.

5. Add the changed index file to the repository, commit, and push to
   gh-pages.

6. In your browser to go the **username.github.io/reveal** URL. You
   should see the opening slide of your presentation.
